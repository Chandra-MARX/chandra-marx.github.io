.. _sect-tests.source:

Sources in |marx|
=============================================================================

|marx| offers several different source shapes. Tests in this module exercise
those sources (except ``SAOSAC``, which is heavily used in
:ref:`sect-tests.PSF` already).






.. _sect-test-GeometricSources:

Build-in geometric sources
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


:code: :ref:`test-code-GeometricSources`

This test exercises build-in |marx| sources with different geometric
shapes.
Most source types have parameters, and not all parameters are tested here.
See :ref:`sect-sourcemodels` for a detailed description of source
parameters.




.. figure:: figures/GeometricSources_ds9.*
   :align: center
   :alt: Six PSFs.
   :scale: 75%



   `ds9`_ image of the simulated PSFs in alphabetical order (beta distribution, disk, disk with hole, Gauss, line, and point).







.. _sect-test-ImageSource:

Image as source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


:code: :ref:`test-code-ImageSource`

An image can be used as |marx| input. In this case, the intensity of the
X-ray radiation on that sky is taken to be proportional to the value of the
image at that point.




.. figure:: figures/ImageSource_ds9.*
   :align: center
   :alt: The simulated events generally follow the input image, but with significant noise because of the short observation time.
   :scale: 75%



   `ds9`_ shows the input image (left) and the simulated event list (right).







.. _sect-test-UserSource:

Compiling a USER source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


:code: :ref:`test-code-UserSource`

Run an example for a USER source.

|marx| comes with several examples for user written source in C.
These can be compiled as shared objects and dynamically linked into |marx|
at run time.
To test this, we copy one of the source files from the installed |marx|
version and compile it with gcc. This particular case is not very useful,
because |marx| already has a point source with the same properties
build-in. The purpose of this test is only to have an automatic check that
the dynamic linking works.




.. figure:: figures/UserSource_ds9.*
   :align: center
   :alt: A point source
   :scale: 75%



   `ds9`_ shows that the distribution of source is indeed a point source.
